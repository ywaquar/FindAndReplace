# Project Title
Find And Replace Web App

# Description
This Find And Replace Web App was developed to address a specific data correction challenge within our organization.  
As a Data Analyst, I often encounter data processed by a machine learning web app with errors that need correction.  
The traditional manual approach of finding and replacing in Google Sheets was time-consuming and frustrating.  
To streamline this process, I created this web app, saving valuable time and resources for our company.  

# Problem Statement
Role: Data Analyst  
Challenge: Correcting errors in data processed by a machine learning web app.  
Previous Approach: Manual find and replace in Google Sheets.  
Frustration: Time-consuming and inefficient.  
Solution: Developed Find And Replace Web App.  

# App Overview
This web app utilizes the Google Sheets API to authenticate and retrieve data. It consists of two main modules:  

GoogleSheetData.py: Manages authentication and reads data from Google Sheets.  
FindAndReplace.py: Performs find-and-replace operations on the data and stores the results in an Excel file.  

# Dependencies  
Ensure you have the required libraries installed by referencing the requirements.txt file.  

# Installation
Follow these steps to set up the Find And Replace Web App on your system.  

Clone the repository to your local machine.
